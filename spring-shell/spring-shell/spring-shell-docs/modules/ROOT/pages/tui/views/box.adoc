allows to do simple things without implementing a full custom `View`.

== Customisation
_BoxView_ as mostly being a base class contains some useful features
like if it should draw a border and what what are its paddings.
Border can have a title and its color and focused color can be
defined. It's also possible to explicitely set background color
which will override one from styling.

== Default Bindings
Does not have any default bindings.

== Events
Does not have any events.
