:page-section-summary-toc: 1

When an exception occurs inside command code, it is caught by the shell and a simple, one-line message is displayed
so as not to overflow the user with too much information.
There are cases, though, when understanding what exactly happened is important (especially if the exception has a nested cause).

To this end, Spring Shell remembers the last exception that occurred, and the user can later use the `stacktrace`
command to print all the details on the console.
